# Serial Unity Project
## Outline
This is one of the projects I am prouder of, its a unity package that allows the user to read data of serial with ease. I initially developed it during my first year of university and further developed it in my second. 

It was developed to fill a need, at Falmouth Unvierstity we where initially using an alternative unity package to handle serial data, however this was causing issues with peoples projects whilst also no longer being updated. 

I developed this for my own personal use but it got the attention of university staff and I was asked if it could be use by the new cohort of first years. 

I developed it further and enjoyed spending time as a proto-technician for a short period of time, helping students in the lab and lectures and ttending some meetings of academic staff.
