# Silent Steps
## Outline
Silent steps is one of my earliest university projects and arguably my favourite, a small wheeled robot that will calculate your position based on sounds you create. 

The project is built using C++ and an arduino based microntroller a [Teensy 4.1](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html). It uses time difference of arrival (TDOA) and 3 microphones equally spaced apart on a triangular platform in the center of the robot. 

I learnt so much during this small project, from making my own libraries for arduino, the complex maths surroudning TDOA and click together construction using 3D printing to allow for easy assembling. With the justification being to be able to sell this as a small kit for children to click together and use as a toy.
