# About Me
A final year robotics student with a keen interest in computer vision and embedded software solutions.  During my time at university I have cultivated expertise in C++, C, Python, as well as computer vision solutions such as TensorFlow, OpenCV and PyTorch.  This knowledge extends into commercial projects, in the field of agricultural technology, where I have been able to co-found Avoro Technologies and leverage these skills to develop an innovative daffodil picking robot.
